## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Goals for this project was to make sure that a user can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
